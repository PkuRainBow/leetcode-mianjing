/**
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

For example:

Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},

    1

   / \

  2   3

 / \

4   5

return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].

   4

  / \

 5   2

    / \

   3   1
